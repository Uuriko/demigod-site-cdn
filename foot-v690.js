/**
 * v648 a11y: focus now enters the WIZ dialog on open. show()'s focus query matched the
 *   first input in DOM order (contact-email, on a later step, HIDDEN on welcome) and
 *   .focus() on a non-visible element is a silent no-op — focus stayed on BODY, so
 *   screen-reader users never heard the dialog. Now filters for visibility.
 * v567 positioning: Demigod tech + humans in the loop (not hand-matched)

 * v528 scroll-margin for skip-link targets under sticky chrome
 * v527 path-pills touch target + focus-visible (redesign a11y)
 * v526 forceMainVisible: steps/roles/pricing grids use display:grid (not flex)

 * v510 closed WIZ modals set inert+aria-hidden (crawl/SEO: reduce form text when closed)
 * v509 WIZ progress: '1 of 7' spacing (firecrawl read '1/of 7' — slash glued to of)
 * v508 footer nav: /contact had zero inbound links (DG_PAGES entry + route worked, unreachable from UI) — same orphan-page class as v504/v505/v507 fees/security/sample/pilot; added to #dg-legal-links

var DG_BLOG_POSTS=[{"slug":"epicurus-garden-hacker-houses","category":"Market","title":"Epicurus' Garden and the SF hacker house","summary":"Epicurus wanted friendship and a quiet mind. SF hacker houses want speed. The useful overlap is smaller: choose the room carefully, write the norms down, and leave room to recover.","body":"Around 306 BCE, Epicurus bought a house and garden outside the Dipylon gate, on the road toward Plato's Academy. Diogenes Laërtius puts the price at eighty minae, writing centuries later, so treat that number the way you would any figure from one late source. What is better attested is how the place ran. People lived there. They ate at one table, argued over the food, and came back to the same unfinished questions the next week. The Academy up the road was a school you visited. The Garden was one you moved into, which changed what it could ask of the people in it.\n\nThey were after ataraxia: a quieter mind, less fear, fewer pointless wants. Friendship was part of the practice, not a networking bonus. Women studied there. So did people the rest of the city treated as background. That made the Garden unusually open for an Athenian school, but it was not casual about commitment. If you needed public honor more than the shared table, you did not last.\n\nEpicurus's will tried to keep the group going after him. Successors named. Friends' children cared for. Freedom for slaves who had studied. The legal language is dry and that is the point. The house was supposed to outlive one charismatic man.\n\nYou see cousins of this arrangement long before anyone rented a Victorian in the Mission and called it a house for builders. Pythagoras's circle in southern Italy was harsher and weirder: shared property, heavy secrecy, intellectual heat with a mystic edge. Monasteries later made a more durable version of group life. Their purposes were religious, their rules stricter, their days split between prayer, labor, and study. They also copied books.\n\nIn 1417, Poggio Bracciolini found Lucretius' On the Nature of Things in a monastic library. Lucretius was the great Roman carrier of Epicurean thought. A Christian house preserved a poem whose gods, matter, and death sat badly with Christian teaching. Nobody needed to plan that irony. The rule said copy books, so books got copied, including ones the copyists would have disliked if they stopped to argue with every page. That is a boring reason to write shared rules down, and a strong one. Rules keep operating on days when nobody is in the mood to remember the founding pitch.\n\nSan Francisco keeps reinventing a louder cousin of the same pressure. Rent is absurd. Solo technical work is lonely. Hard problems move faster when the people who can help are down the hall instead of three Slack hops and a calendar invite away.\n\nReporting on HF0 describes a selective residency for technical founders in large SF properties. AGI House has been covered as a place for AI builders, researchers, dinners, and events. Those are specific organizations with their own admissions and economics. They are useful because the trade is visible. Residents give up privacy and some control over the room in exchange for people, conversation, and work being close.\n\nProximity helps when the people already share enough. A stuck problem can come up over eggs. Someone can watch a demo fail and still be there when the fix works at midnight. Proximity has no moral quality of its own. If residents disagree about noise, money, ambition, cleanliness, or whether every meal is a pitch session, the hallway becomes another meeting they cannot leave.\n\nFounder mythology likes to skip the boring part. A house full of impressive résumés can be worse than a smaller one where people agree about visitors, quiet hours, chores, and rest. Size photographs well. Norms decide whether anyone wants to stay. Intensity needs a limit too. Epicurus treated modest pleasure, freedom from fear, and time among friends as the point. A modern technical residency may be trying to ship a company in weeks. Different aims. Both get worse when sleep thins, the kitchen turns strange, and small annoyances become politics.\n\nDemigod is not a house, and we will not pretend the lineage is direct. We run a matching service for SF startups and talent: profiles stay private, both sides see evidence before names move, and an introduction happens only after each side approves. What we take from the houses is a working assumption rather than a philosophy. Selection has to be honest before proximity is worth much, because the wrong people in a good room mostly cost each other a month.\n\nWhether any of this works outside one small city is an open question. SF is where we can check our own claims in person, so SF is where we operate.","image":"https://files.catbox.moe/urbco5.jpg","imageAlt":"Gold-on-dark mark for garden, cloister, and group-house pattern essay","publishedAt":"2026-07-17"}];
